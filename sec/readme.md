# Threat Model for Azure API Management (Internal Mode) with Front Door

## Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **External Consumers** accessing APIs from the public internet
2. **Azure Front Door** serving as the global edge service and entry point
3. **Private Link Services** connecting Front Door to API Management
4. **API Management** deployed in internal mode within a VNet/Subnet
5. **Azure-hosted Backend Services** including Function Apps, Logic Apps, and Kubernetes Services
6. **Internally Hosted Backend Endpoints** (on-premises servers)
7. **Internal Network Consumers** accessing APIs directly through internal network routing
8. **Internal DNS Resolution and Routing Configuration** for internal traffic management
9. **Network Connectivity Options** including ER (ExpressRoute), VPN, Peering, and MultiSpoke

## Trust Boundaries

1. **Untrusted (Internet) Zone**
   - External Consumers
   - External APIs (third-party services)

2. **Azure Service Boundary**
   - Front Door and its services
   - Private Link boundary

3. **Virtual Network Boundary**
   - API Management Subnet
   - Azure-hosted Backend Services

4. **Internal Network Boundary**
   - Internal Network routing
   - On-premises backend services
   - Internal consumers

## Data Flow Paths

1. **External Consumer → Front Door → Private Link → API Management → Azure/Internal Backends**
   - External clients access APIs through the public internet
   - Traffic is routed through Azure Front Door
   - Front Door connects to API Management through Private Link
   - API Management routes to appropriate backends

2. **Internal Consumer → Internal Network → API Management → Azure/Internal Backends**
   - Internal clients access APIs directly through the internal network
   - Traffic bypasses Front Door
   - Internal DNS resolution routes traffic to API Management
   - API Management routes to appropriate backends
